### Lab 02 - Polarization
- Experiment 1.ipynb
  - Compared the falloff of relative intensity of a light over a distance
  - Compared the change in light intensity due to the relative angle of linear polarizers
### DataAnalysis.py
- This file is imported into the ipynb files used in the labs to consolidate common analysis functions between labs such as calculating covariance and correlation coefficents.
